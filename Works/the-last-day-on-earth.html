									I sit on the roof of my car, looking up at the stars. Denise jumps up onto the bonnet. She sinks a few centimetres, and the car’s crumpled metal makes her lose her balance. <br>
									<x></x>“Denise!” I shout. More of a reflex really, the whole concept of ‘Consequences don’t matter anymore’ hasn't sunk in yet. <br>
									<x></x>“So what?” Denise smiles, “It’s not like you can take it anywhere. Plus, the world’s ending!”  <br>
									<x></x>“I hadn’t forgotten.” <br>
									<x></x>Denise proceeds to jump up and down on the bonnet, making a god awful amount of noise. <br>
									<x></x>“Denise! The drinks!” <br>
									<x></x>She looks down, and realises that the two cokes she was supposed to bring us were now positively fucked. <br>
									<x></x>“Oh shit,” she says. <br>
									<x></x>She jumps up onto the roof, and shifts over beside me. <br>
									<x></x>“Give me one,” I say.  <br>
									<x></x>“Leila-”  <br>
									<x></x>“So what?” I say, “the world's ending.” I give her a light nudge with my shoulder, and she hands me the can. Aiming it out into the vast desert in front of us, I crack open the can, and a stream of brown foam—with some force—shoots out onto the ground in front of me. <br>
									<x></x>Denise laughs, and does the same.  <br>
									<x></x>I flick what liquid is left on my hands onto her, and take a sip. I spit it out immediately, “Eugh, it’s warm!” <br>
									<x></x>“So what? The-”  <br>
									<x></x>“Shut up,” I laugh.  <br>
									<x></x>There's a moment of silence, I look up at the stars, Denise stares down at the ground. The moment turns into an eternity, and we’re sucked into the void of our own thoughts. <br>
									<x></x>“The powers out,” Denise says slowly. “I guess whoever works there got up and left, wanted to spend the last day with their families…” She trails off. <br>
									<x></x>“That's why the coke’s warm.” <br>
									<x></x>I laugh, a short breath.  <br>
									<x></x>Denise turns to me, “What is it?” <br>
									<x></x>“I just never thought that I’d be spending the <i>last</i> 16 hours of my life, with a total stranger.” <br>
									<x></x>“Hey, I’m not a <i>total</i> stranger, we met at the wedding, remember?” <br>
									<x></x>The wedding. Sharon's wedding. That seems like a lifetime ago. Back then my life had meaning, I had things to look forward to, people to meet, now all that I have is… <br>
									Is Denise. <br>
									<x></x>“What did it all add up to?” I ask. <br>
									<x></x>“Hm?” <br>
									<x></x>I take another sip of my warm coke, stand up, and toss the still full can as far as I can. It makes it just over the road, and lands in the dirt on the other side. <br>
									<x></x>I stand there, the breeze blowing through my hair, watching as a few ants spot the coke soaked dirt. <br>
									<x></x>“All the decisions in my life, all the things that I did, they were all <i>for</i> something, right? When I look back on my life when I’m all grey and old I was supposed to say ‘<i>I did something.</i>’ And. Given <i>literally</i> any other situation, I could say that about my life now. But the worlds <i>fucking ending,</i> and nobody, <i>nothing,</i> is going to mean anything anymore. Nothing I did, or anybody did, is going to have any impact.” <br>
									<x></x>Denise snorts, “The only thing that’s making an impact any time soon is that asteroid.” <br>
									<x></x>“Why?” I ask, “Why do you say things like this?” <br>
									<x></x>There’s a pause. “To cope.”  <br>
									<x></x>Another moment of silence. No point lying to yourself anymore. <br>
									<x></x>“Leila,” she says, “I’m fucking scared.” <br>
									<x></x>“I know… I am too.” <br>
									<x></x>Denise looks up at the stars with me. “… To think we don’t even get the pleasure of seeing it.” <br>
									<x></x>“I think it’s for the best,“ I say, “we wouldn’t want it hanging over our heads.” <br>
									<x></x>This makes Denise laugh, and she gives me a punch in the arm. “Come on,” she says, “let’s find something to eat.”  <br>
									<x></x>“Oh, you're hungry now?” <br>
									<x></x>“Fuck yeah I am. What’s the bet we can find some of Sharon’s wedding cake?”  <br>
									<x></x>I jump down from the roof. “Alright,” I say, “let’s go.” <br>
