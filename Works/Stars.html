									“I’ve never seen something so beautiful…” <br>
									Millions of lights dotted the sky, and the vibrant arm of the Milky Way swept across the night. It made Agnes feel incredibly small. <br>
										 “I’d say you‘re just a city girl who‘s easily impressed,” said Jeff, “but yeah, you never really get used to it.” <br>
										 “Is it like this every night?” Agnes asked. <br>
										 “Mostly, yeah.” <br>
										 They both sat in silence for a moment, Agnes dangling her legs off the edge of the roof, not tearing her eyes off of the night sky. <br>
										 “What are nights like in the city?” <br>
										 “Nothing like this,” Agnes said, “it’s loud, bright; you could never see the sky, even on clear nights like this.” <br>
										 “What could you see then?” Jeff asked, not mocking, just genuinely curious. <br>
										 Agnes sat there, unmoving. <br>
										 “Nothing… just black.” <br>
										 She heard the faint squabble of chickens in the barn, then silence. <br>
										 “I guess… I know why my parents never visited much,” she said. “Compared to this,” -she stretched her hands out to the sky, as if reaching for something- “the city kinda sucks doesn’t it?” <br>
										 “Yeah. They really loved it here.” <br>
										 “I… I just wish I could have been there when…” <br>
										 “Hey,” Jeff said, “no one’s blaming you.” <br>
										 “<i>I</i> am,” Agnes said, “why the hell did I move out in the first place?” <br>
										 Her voice lowered. “What was I running from?” <br>
										 Up In the tree against the dirt road, an owl flew off from one of the branches, leaving the trunk slowly swaying in the still breeze. <br>
										 “I love it here,” Agnes said, as if trying to convince herself. <br>
										 Jeff said nothing. <br>
										 Agnes laughed to herself, “You know what I was planning on doing?” she said, “I was planning on selling the farm to you, and going back to the city, and using the money to buy a bigger apartment, maybe even one closer to work.” <br>
										 “But plans changed?” <br>
										 “No,” Agnes said, “I did.” <br>
