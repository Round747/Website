									“Elaine!” <br>
									<x></x> No answer. <br>
									<x></x>Rob knocked harder.<br>
									<x></x>She pulled open the door, “What?”<br>
									<x></x>“Can I look at your fridge?”<br>
									<x></x>She blinked. “... Why?”<br>
									<x></x>“You said it was on the fritz.”<br>
									<x></x>“... Oh, yeah, no. It’s all good now.”<br>
									<x></x>“But all your stuff is still in <i>my</i> fridge.”<br>
									<x></x>“Y- Yeah. I was going to get it eventually.”<br>
									<x></x>Rob stepped past her, and into the dark apartment.<br>
									<x></x>“H-Hey!”<br>
									<x></x>As Rob walked down the dim hallway, the faint smell of cigarettes licked at his senses; he spotted a few butts in an ashtray. After a second, he noticed how cold it was.<br>
									<x></x> Elaine ran past him, and swept a few beer cans into the bin. Her bright red face contrasted the dark bags under her eyes.<br>
									<x></x> There was a pause, then she made an act of spotting the fridge.<br>
									<x></x>“Oh, it’s turned off again,” she said, “bloody thing.”<br>
									<x></x>Rob moved up to the fridge, and looked it up and down. “It must be a power supply issue.”<br>
									<x></x>“Rob, you don’t have to-”<br>
									<x></x>“No, it’s fine.” He leant down, and tried to pull the fridge out from the wall. After a few attempts, he looked back. “... Can you help?”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine didn’t move. She just looked absentmindedly at him, arms crossed.<br>
									<x></x>“Do you want your fridge fixed or not?”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine looked away, opened her mouth, then shut it again. “... No.”<br>
									<x></x>“What?”<br>
									<x></x>“I don’t want you to.”<br>
									<x></x>“Why not?”<br>
									<x></x>“I jus- You’ll kill yourself on some electrical outlet or something. Just stop.”<br>
									<x></x>“I’m not going to pull it apart or anything, I’m just looking.”<br>
									<x></x>“I can do that myself.”<br>
									<x></x>“You’re not by yourself Elaine. I’m here.”<br>
									<x></x>“Because you barged in.”<br>
									<x></x>“I’m <i>trying</i> to help.”<br>
									<x></x>“Just fuck off Robert!” She paused, then looked away. “I didn’t <i>ask</i> for your help.”<br>
									<x></x>Rob looked at her, then back at the fridge. “Fine.”<br>
									<x></x>He got up and pushed the fridge back, walking off with a huff.<br>
									<x></x>“At least turn a light on, it’s bloody dark in here,” he said, hitting the kitchen light switch.<br>
									<x></x>Nothing happened.<br>
									<x></x>Rob looked up at the light, and flicked the switch on and off again. No response.<br>
									<x></x>He looked to Elaine. Her face was bright red again.<br>
									<x></x>Rob walked up to her coffee table, and grabbed the remote to the air con. None of the buttons did anything.<br>
									<x></x>“... There’s nothing wrong with your fridge, is there?”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine’s lip trembled, she wanted to say something, but couldn’t find any words. She looked to Rob like she was about to cry.<br>
									<x></x>Rob walked up to her, and sat on a kitchen stool next to her. “What’s going on?” he asked softly.<br>
									<x></x>She said nothing for almost a minute, just staring at the floor in front of her.<br>
									<x></x>Rob waited.<br>
									<x></x>“I… I was drunk,” she said eventually. “Or- or high. Or probably both, and I did something really, <i>really</i> stupid. And my boss…”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine risked a glance in Rob’s direction. “... I lost my job.”<br>
									<x></x>Rob stared at the patch of floor with her.<br>
									<x></x>“Do you want to stay at my place for a bit?” He asked after a while.<br>
									<x></x>“... It’s warm… And bright.”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine did something between a laugh and a sob. “You’re an arsehole.”<br>
									<x></x>“I know,” he said. He got up, then held out his hand, “come on.”<br>
									<x></x>Elaine blushed, then reluctantly took his hand.
